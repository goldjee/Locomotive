# Locomotive
Small extensible JAVA Steam API caller

Currently depends on Unirest library as a REST connector. But if you want to, you can easily change contents of locomotive.network.requester to use any external library you want.

Also would like to thank nosoop for providing VDF2JSON class. Source can be found here: https://github.com/nosoop/vdf-json-java
